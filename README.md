# Seasoned

**Seasoned** is a modern, recipe-first platform for creating, maintaining, and sharing recipes — with built-in meal planning through a calendar-based experience.

The project is composed of two main parts:

- **Ingredients** — a reusable component library
- **Entree** — a Progressive Web App (PWA) built using Ingredients
